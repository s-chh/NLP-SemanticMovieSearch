Leon (Jean Reno) is a hitman (or "cleaner" as he would rather be known) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. Most of his work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the "Supreme Macaroni Company" retail store. Leon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his "best friend", and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals. Leon is highly motivated and efficient. He kills plenty of bodyguards (Ed Ventresca) so that a fat guy called Fatman (Frank Senger) receives a phonecall threatening him. A dumb blonde (Ouin-Ouin) walks away non-noncommittally and says she will call him later, not wanting to get involved in the matter. On a particular day on his way home, he sees Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a ragged and drug-addicted Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield shoots Mathilda's entire family with a shotgun; the whore-looking mother (Ellen Greene), the aerobic-obsessed elder sister (Elizabeth Regen) and the friendly little brother (Carl J. Matusovich)- missing Mathilda only because she is out shopping when they arrive. An elderly lady (Jessie Keosian) comes back inquiring what the rackas is about, and Stansfield shoots the glass behind her, but considers her harmless so he let us her be, just barking at her "go back inside". When Mathilda returns with the groceries she was sent to buy and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway past the open door of her family's apartment, and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Leon. One of the agents () looks at Mathilda, quizzingly, as she has to insistently ring the bell on and on before Leon let us her in. Stansfield realises that there is a little girl missing because of a family photograph he is found. When the news reaches the door guard, he approaches Leon's apartment, wondering whether the girl who was accepted there was the missing girl. Leon prepares himself to shoot him, watching through a hidden peephole, but at that moment, Mathilda turns on the TV with some Transformers cartoons, which convinces the guard that he saw another girl who had nothing to do with the situation. Leon offers some consolation to Mathilda, making her smile when he argues than pigs smell well and are better than many people, and make-pretends that the puppet pig he is using is talking to her. Mathilda, who soon discovers that Leon is a hitman, begs him to become her caretaker, and to teach her his skills as a "cleaner": she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family that she actually loved. In return, she offers herself as a maid and teacher, remedying Leon's illiteracy. Mathilda says that he could have let her to die outside that door, but as he opened it, now he is responsible for her well-being. At first, Leon refuses point blank: being a "cleaner" is not a job for girls, and then he alleges that she is not made for that. To answer to that, Mathilda shoots some pigeons with one of the guns Leon is cleaning. Leon hesitantly accepts her offer and the two begin working together, slowly building an emotional attachment, with Leon becoming a friend and father figure. They leave Leon's apartment, and Leon begins to settle some rules. Mathilda carries Leon's plant, accepting everything, and convinces the receptionist (George Martin) that she is preparing for an audition, and that she will not practice after 10. When the receptionist asks Leon to fill up the registration form, Mathilda jumps right in and says "You know how much I love registering. Can I do it, daddy?" Leon breaths, and apprecciates that Mathilda is resourceful. The receptionist congratulates Leon because he is got a good daughter, but he is got a 17-year-old who cannot do anything. Leon leaves his plant at reception. He checks everything in the room, the exits, the windows, while Mathilda fills up the form. As they work together, Mathilda admits to Leon several times that she is falling in love with him, in spite of him making her drink a glass of milk every day. Tony has been keeping Leon's money, instead of it being put into a bank. As Leon was illiterate, he did not want to have to deal with it. Leon asks if he could give it to somebody; Tony tells him that he is like a bank, only that there is no paperwork involved, but that he is got all the accountancy in his mind, and that is security enough. Tony wants Leon to renew work, as training will not earn him any money. Leon prevents Mathilda from flirting with a guy (Michael Mundra), a teenaged cute boy little older than herself; she replies that they we are only sharing a cigarette - to which Leon answers that he wants her to quit smoking. Leon adds that she should stay away from him, as he looks like a weirdo. Leon goes to work on his own on foot. Mathilda says that she is fed up of practicing to the receptionist. Mathilda tells him that Leon is not her father, but her lover, and that she is going for walk. Mathilda goes back to her old flat, and picks up a teddy bear and a pad of money hidden under a loose wooden plank. She has to hide, because the FBI is questioning Stansfield, who is being a jackass about the people he killed in the line of duty. He shouts to the FBI guy that kids should be at school, and also shouts his office number. Mathilda follows Stansfield by taxi to the police station. Mathilda is watching cartoon Transformers again when Leon arrives with blood dripping down an arm and a pink dress for her. The receptionist arrives with two men, throwing Leon and Mathilda out. In another hotel room, Leon has a shower and stitches himself in the chest, where he is been hurt. Mathilda wants to pay Leon to kill her brother's killers, but Leon does not want to. He tells her that life changes after the first time you kill somebody. She wants to play Russian roulette with him. She threatens him with killing herself - and at the last second he pushes the pistol away. Mathilda and Leon go talk with Tony. As Mathilda increases her confidence and experience, she locates Stansfield, follows him to his office in the DEA building in an attempt to kill him, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Leon, discovering her intentions after reading a note left for him by Mathilda, rushes to the building and rescues her, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process. Stansfield is enraged that the "Italian hitman" has gone rogue and is killing his men. He confronts Tony and threatens him, eventually beating him into surrendering Leon's whereabouts. Later, as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Leon's apartment. Leon ambushes the ESU team and takes one of their members hostage, rapidly bartering him for Mathilda's freedom. As they slink back into the apartment, Leon creates a quick escape for Matilda as he reassures her and tells her that he loves her moments before they come for him. In the chaos that follows, Leon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer, almost unnoticed save for Stansfield who recognizes him and silently sneaks up and shoots him from behind. Looming over the dying Leon, Stansfield jeers him haughtily. However just before he gives out, Leon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is "from Mathilda". Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade and rips open Leon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest. Stansfield let us out a brief and final quip "Oh, shit" right before a massive explosion devastates them both. Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Leon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a few dollars of the fortune Leon had amassed, which was being held by Tony. His reasoning is that she is not old enough to receive the large amount of money and that school should be her priority until she is older. When Mathilda asks Tony to give her a 'job', and insists that she can 'clean' as Leon had, Tony sternly informs her that he 'are not got no work for a 12-year-old kid!' Having nowhere else to go, she is then seen going to Roosevelt Island using the Roosevelt Island Tramway. The next day, she returns to school in NJ. Seemingly readmitted to the school, Mathilda walks into a field in front of it with Leon's houseplant in hand, she digs a hole and plants the houseplant in the grounds of the school, as she had told Leon he should, "to give it roots.
